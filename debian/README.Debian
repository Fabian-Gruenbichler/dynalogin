dynalogin on Debian
-------------------

  This is the initial packaging of dynalogin for Debian.

  The administrator must create the database manually (if database is
  used) and configure the UNIX ODBC properties files in /etc

  Config location, by default, is /etc/dynalogind.conf

  Debian is the primary development and test platform for dynalogin

  Please see the web page and wiki for more detailed documentation:
