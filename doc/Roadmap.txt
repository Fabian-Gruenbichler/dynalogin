Completed/usable:
- build system (autotools)
- project hosting (Drupal/Sourceforge)
- user data storage with file and unixODBC modules
- controller capable of retrieving user data and invoking the
  HOTP and TOTP algorithms
- privilege separation: daemon process (dynalogind) for accepting 
  TCP connections, conversing with a client process that wishes
  to perform user authentication and invoking the controller routines
- TLS support
- C client library with TLS support for connecting to the dynalogin server
- PAM module that uses the C client library to connect to a dynalogin
  server securely across the network
- PHP sample working with SimpleID for SSO

Project roadmap:

- SASL mechanism, for example, CROTP:
   http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-josefsson-kitten-crotp-00

- extend client-server protocol for use on the TCP socket to cover more
  algorithms

- Java client JAR
  - Use cases for the client JAR:
    - authentication within Java based web applications (WAR deployments)
