Completed/usable:
- build system (autotools)
- project hosting (Drupal/Sourceforge)
- user data storage with file and unixODBC modules
- controller capable of retrieving user data and invoking the
  HOTP algorithm
- privilege separation: daemon process (dynalogind) for accepting 
  TCP connections, conversing with a client process that wishes
  to perform user authentication and invoking the controller routines

Project roadmap:

- SASL mechanism, for example, CROTP:
   http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-josefsson-kitten-crotp-00

- finalise and document client-server protocol for use on the TCP socket

- Adapt a PHP OpenID sample to utilise dynalogind by
  communicating on the socket with the server

- C client library for client-server communication
  - Use cases for the C client library:
    - PAM module
    - PHP module
    - Apache module

- Java client JAR
  - Use cases for the client JAR:
    - authentication within Java based web applications (WAR deployments)

- Development of a soft token solution for mobile platforms
