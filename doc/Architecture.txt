dynalogin is designed to be small, light and efficient.  This is
important for security code, as it is easier to read and understand.

With this in mind, the following dependencies were chosen as building
blocks:

- Apache APR: chosen due to the platform-independent flexibility, 
  convenient memory pools and great support from the APR community.

- oath-toolkit: a self-contained HOTP/TOTP implementation that is
  well supported by Simon Josefsson

- unixODBC: a flexible way of accessing multiple databases

- gnutls: state-of-the-art TLS support for UNIX, with GNU freedom

- GNU autotools: the most widely used build system for Free software
