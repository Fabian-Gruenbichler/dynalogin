1. Build the binaries (see BUILD.txt)

2. Create the users file/database

3. Create a user in the users file/database
   
     - the user's secret should be the same as the secret used
       to initialise the token

4. Run the test application:

     ./dynalogin_tester username

5. Generate a HOTP code from the token

6. Enter the HOTP code into the tester

7. Try various tests:

     - attempt to re-use a token code
     - attempt to generate more than HOTP_WINDOW (default 20) token codes
       without entering any of them in the tester, and then try the next
       code
     - attempt to enter various random numbers
     - attempt multiple consecutive failures
     - inspect the database content after each attempt
